# CryptoClustering
# Background

In this challenge, I used my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Prepare the Data

Used the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

Created a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.
